| 4.7.  | 2            | Initialize the project, pick a name, decide the key technologies (React/TypeScrip/Node/GraphQL/Postgresql), write the initial readme, add React/TypeScript skeleton and webpack configs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5.7.  | 5            | Mess around with webpack on the frontend (no commits), create skeleton for backend, add initial Prisma integration, implement GraphQL API for adding users, connect frontend to backend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 7.7.  | 5            | Spend a lot of time messing around with TypeScript typings. Add Redux to the project. Do some reading on state management and GraphQL only to realize that Redux is probably not needed. Also come to the conclusion that custom webpack at this point is a bit too cumbersome, backtrack on that as well. Commit work on Redux if I decide to come back to that later.                                                                                                                                        |
| 8.7.  | 10           | Rebase frontend on create-creat-app. A lot of new components in the frontend for future use. A lot of work on trying to figure out how to deal with login/sign up in the backend. Play around with Prisma to get authentication to actually work (multiple iterations of failures). Implement some basic queries on the new backend. Add authentication, sign in/out as well creating of new users to the frontend. Connect more components to the backend                                                     |
| 9.7.  | 11           | Add material ui to the project. Add new components and functionality. Implement dark theme. Unify code. Add notifications (not yet in use).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10.7. | 10           | Spend hours on figuring out how to deploy prisma server to heroku. Decide to self host the site. Buy domain from namecheap and VPS from Vultr. Set up a Linux install on the VPS. Work on Dockerfiles. Try to write a Docker-compose file that could spin up nginx, frontend, backend, prisma and postgresql, decide to do that later. Deploy the site to the VPS manually. Push the frontend to Docker Hub. Read on how to build a CI/CD pipeline that would spin the updated Docker Hub container on update. |
| 11.7. | 10           | Move various setting definitions to environment variables on both the backend and frontend. Update documentation. Add admin panel for both products and users (MaterialTable). Improve react router by adding Switch and default pages. Make use of refetchQueries. Clean up code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12.7. | 3.5          | Add GraphQL subscriptions to the backend and enable websockets on the frontend (took some time because Prisma Nexus support isn't yet official). Started using Apollo for state management. Finally fixed the Notifications. Added couple of helper functions to manage the notifications, made use of it everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Total | 56.5         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
