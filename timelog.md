| 4.7.  | 2            | Initialize the project, pick a name, decide the key technologies (React/TypeScrip/Node/GraphQL/Postgresql), write the initial readme, add React/TypeScript skeleton and webpack configs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5.7.  | 5            | Mess around with webpack on the frontend (no commits), create skeleton for backend, add initial Prisma integration, implement GraphQL API for adding users, connect frontend to backend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7.7.  | 5            | Spend a lot of time messing around with TypeScript typings. Add Redux to the project. Do some reading on state management and GraphQL only to realize that Redux is probably not needed. Also come to the conclusion that custom webpack at this point is a bit too cumbersome, backtrack on that as well. Commit work on Redux if I decide to come back to that later.                                                                                    |
| 8.7.  | 10           | Rebase frontend on create-creat-app. A lot of new components in the frontend for future use. A lot of work on trying to figure out how to deal with login/sign up in the backend. Play around with Prisma to get authentication to actually work (multiple iterations of failures). Implement some basic queries on the new backend. Add authentication, sign in/out as well creating of new users to the frontend. Connect more components to the backend |
| 9.7.  | 5            | Add material ui to the project. Add new components and functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
