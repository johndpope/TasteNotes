Application for keeping track of things you have recently tasted. It mimics the functionality and the interface of the popular tasting apps such as Untapped and Vivino. Unlike the previously mentioned apps however, it'll support arbitrary types of foods and drinks such as sodas, coffees or anything else you can imagine.

## Technology Stack

The application will be written using React, Redux and TypeScript in the frontend and Node.js and TypeScript in the backend. GraphQL will be used for communication between the application and the server. Prisma will be used to generate the GraphQL APIs and SQL queries. PostgreSQL will be used as the database.
